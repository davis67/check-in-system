# Design Hub Check In System

### Current Status:

Under the new covid SOPs set by the government, Design Hub manually
registers all people coming into the space to aid in the tracking of contacts, this has created a lot
of paperwork that has piled up and also alot of repetition of simple tasks.

### Solution:

Create an online check in system that will aid in removing the manual process, will
also remove duplication in the data collected
Data currently being collected includes: Name(required), temperature(required),
company(required), id no(optional), telephone number(required), date(required).
How the system will work:

1. System will be closed and accounts for users(data entrants/receptionists) will be created
   by the system admin.
2. Once the receptionist logs in, he/she will be redirected to a homepage consisting of a
   search box and a list of previous checkin visitors/tenants to the design hub.
3. He/She will be able to add a new visitor/tenant, add new temperature readings to
   existing tenants/visitors in the system.
   a. If the tenant/visitor is already recorded, the receptionist will just add the
   measured temperature and the date(which is automatically created).
